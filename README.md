# World Comment (Sub*note*ica)

Post comments associated with locations from your in-game world. An idea similar to [Danmaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danmaku_subtitling) in videos, or Subnautica's well-received feedback system.

This mod is inspired by the feedback tool in Subnautica. Players can take a screenshot and leave a comment to send feedback to the production team, the feedback will be sent in association with location information and the production team can see a map of the location with an overall rating. I once came across a YouTube video describing this system, mentioning that it was helpful for the Subnautica production team to see how the design worked.

And it also got me thinking about the idea of [Danmaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danmaku_subtitling); they have the advantage over normal comments in that they relate to the content of the video at a given time, enhancing the viewing experience for the viewer. In this way, something similar could be done for Danmaku in the game world of Minecraft.
